# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 6-1-troll-comprehensive-run-and-report (2026-03-31)

- Bare imports in `run_comprehensive.py:27-31` are fragile if the module is ever imported from outside the attacks/ directory. Works correctly as a script. Consider adding `sys.path` guard if module reuse is needed.

## Deferred from: code review of 6-2-mission-control-dashboard-implementation (2026-03-31)

- **W1: `publication_ready` ignores TRANSITIONING pods** — design decision; transitioning ≠ revoked, threshold check intentionally uses only active count. Reconsider if transitioning pods cause unexpected "NOT READY" signals in demo.
- **W2: Partial write on last JSONL line** — `json.loads` will fail on incomplete last line mid-write; event silently skipped. Acceptable for PoC where writers complete quickly. Production fix: read only complete lines (check for `\n` suffix).
- **W3: `extra=data` aliasing in `parse_consent_event`** — `extra` field holds same dict object as source `data`. Read-only in PoC. Production fix: `extra={k: v for k, v in data.items() if k not in known_fields}`.
- **W4: `_poll_jsonl_task` not cancelled on unmount** — Textual cancels async tasks on exit. Not a concern for demo use.
- **D3: Troll events display ([ATTACKS] tab)** — `troll_events` polled and stored but not rendered. Deferred to Story 6.3 (Funder Intervention Points) where troll summary is contextually relevant to funder audience.
- `DEFAULT_POD_URI` and `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_URI` hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000/ayoub/` regardless of `CSS_BASE_URL` env var. Acceptable for PoC; fix before pilot.
- `blocking_pass` logic ignores `partial` results in blocking categories (ACL, SPARQL). A category with 100% partial results returns `blocking_pass=True`. Intentional per spec ("fails"); revisit if partial = inconclusive is a concern for pilot.
