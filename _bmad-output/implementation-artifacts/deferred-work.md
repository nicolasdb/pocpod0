# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 6-1-troll-comprehensive-run-and-report (2026-03-31)

- Bare imports in `run_comprehensive.py:27-31` are fragile if the module is ever imported from outside the attacks/ directory. Works correctly as a script. Consider adding `sys.path` guard if module reuse is needed.
- `DEFAULT_POD_URI` and `DEFAULT_RESOURCE_URI` hardcoded to `http://localhost:3000/ayoub/` regardless of `CSS_BASE_URL` env var. Acceptable for PoC; fix before pilot.
- `blocking_pass` logic ignores `partial` results in blocking categories (ACL, SPARQL). A category with 100% partial results returns `blocking_pass=True`. Intentional per spec ("fails"); revisit if partial = inconclusive is a concern for pilot.
